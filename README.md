This branch contains the source code for the course website.

### Local development environment

Just the Class is built for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator. View the [quick start guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) for more information. Just the Docs requires no special Jekyll plugins and can run on GitHub Pages' standard Jekyll compiler.

1. Follow the GitHub documentation for [Setting up your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).
1. Start your local Jekyll server.
```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
1. Point your web browser to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
1. Reload your web browser after making a change to preview its effect.

**Note:** In the event that you get an error that says something about "webrick", run `bundle add webrick`.

For more information, refer to [Just the Docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/).
