    "As the spring hits San Diego, more students are looking to surf in their free time. There is a pop-up surf store on Library Walk selling wet suits and surf board to students. Last Saturday, this store sold 250 wet suits to UCSD students. After a surf session, 10 students complained that their wet suits had tears in them, letting the cold ocean water to rush in the suit. In response to the student dissatisfaction, the store claims that 98% of their wet suits are produced without any manufacturing defects. You think this seems unlikely and decide to investigate.\n",
