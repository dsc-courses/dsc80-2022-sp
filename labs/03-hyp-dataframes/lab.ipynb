    "Professor Billy often sends out extra credit surveys asking students for their favorite animals, movies, and other favorite things. These surveys are stored in the `data/extra-credit-surveys` folder. Each file in that folder corresponds to a different survey question (except for `favorite1.csv`, which contains students' names and IDs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how extra credit works:\n",
    "- Each student who has completed at least 75% of the survey questions receives 5 points of extra credit.\n",
    "- If there is at least one survey question that at least 90% of the class answered (e.g. favorite animal), **everyone** in the class receives 1 point of extra credit. This overall class extra credit only applies once, so if for example 95% of students answer the favorite color survey question and 91% answer the favorite animal survey question, the entire class still only receives 1 extra point as a class).\n",
