    "### Missing by Design (MD)\n",
    "- The missing field is deliberately missing. The missing field is deliberately set to null or not collected (hence, \"missing by design\").\n",
    "- The missingness can be exactly predicted when a column will be null, with only knowledge of the other columns using a function of the rows of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)\n",
    "- The missingness of missing value isn't related to the actual, unreported value itself, nor the values in any other fields. The missingness is not systematic.\n",
    "- The missingness is unconditionally uniform across rows. MCAR doesn't bias the observed data.\n",
    "- There is no relationship between the missing data and the any of the other data, observed or missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing at Random (MAR)\n",
    "- The missingness of the missing value has nothing to do with the value itself, but may be related to another field.\n",
    "- The missingness is uniform across rows, perhaps conditional on another column. MAR biases the observed data, but is fixable.\n",
    "- There is a systematic relationship between the missing values and the observed data (but not the missing values themselves).\n",
    "- Difference between MD and MAR: If you can *exactly/always* determine missingness using the other columns, the missingness is MD. If there is just some sort of systematic relationship between the missing columns/values and other columns/values that may help us predict missingness, the missingness is MAR.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Ignorable (NI, aka NMAR)\n",
    "- The missingness of the missing value is related to the actual, unreported value.\n",
    "- NI biases the observed data in unobservable ways.\n",
    "- There is relationship between the propensity of a value to be missing and its value.\n",
