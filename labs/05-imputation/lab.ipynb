    "\n",
    "In [Lecture 13](https://dsc80.com/resources/lectures/lec13/lec13.html#Probabilistic-imputation), you learned how to impute a quantitative column by sampling from the observed values. **One problem with this technique is that the imputation will never generate imputed values that weren't already in the dataset.** For example, 57, 57.5, and 59 are values in the `'child'` column of `new_heights` while 58 is not. Thus, any imputation done by sampling from the observed values in the `'child'` column will not be able to generate a height of 58, even though it's clearly a reasonable value to occur in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep things simple, you will impute the `'child'` column **unconditionally** from the distribution of `'child'` heights present in the dataset. This means that you will use the values present in `'child'` to impute missing values, without looking at other columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "An approach to quantitative imputation that overcomes the limitation mentioned above is as follows:\n",
    "- Create a histogram of observed `'child'` heights, using 10 bins.\n",
    "- Use the histogram to generate a number within the observed range of `'child'` heights:\n",
    "    - The likelihood a generated number belongs to a given bin is equal to the area of that bin. (Remember, in histograms, areas are proportions.)\n",
    "    - Any number within a fixed bin is equally likely to occur.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Let's illustrate this approach with an example. Let `demo` be the array of 10 numbers defined below.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Note that in your process, you don't actually need to draw a histogram – instead, use `np.histogram`.\n",
    "- In the histogram above, we see that $2 \\cdot 0.15 = 0.3 = 30\\%$ of values lie in the [10, 12) bin, $2 \\cdot 0.1 = 0.2 = 20\\%$ of values lie in the [12, 14) bin, and $2 \\cdot 0.25 = 0.5 = 50\\%$ of values lie in the [14, 16] bin.\n",
    "- Next, we need to pick a bin at random. There's a 30\\% chance we pick the [10, 12) bin, a 20\\% chance we pick the [12, 14) bin, and a 50\\% chance we pick the [14, 16] bin. `np.random.choice` will be helpful in picking a bin at random.\n",
    "- Once we pick a bin, we pick a number **uniformly at random** from within the bin. For instance, suppose we randomly chose the [14, 16] bin in the previous step. We then must select a (real) number between 14 and 16 uniformly at random. `np.random.uniform` can help you here.\n",
