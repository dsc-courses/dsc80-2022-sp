    "Much like in DSC 10, this Jupyter Notebook contains the statements of the problems and provides code and Markdown cells to display your answers to the problems.

    "1. The functions and classes in the accompanying `lab.py` file will be tested (a la DSC 20),\n",

Once you've signed up, you can use the API key that comes with the free plan. It has a limit of 250 requests per day, which should be more than enough.
