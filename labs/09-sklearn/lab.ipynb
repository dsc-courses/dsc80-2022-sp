    "- The `StdScalerByGroup` transformer works on an input array/DataFrame `X` whose first column contains groups, and whose remaining columns are quantitative and need to be standardized (within each group).\n",
    "- The `fit` method should determine the mean and standard deviation of each quantitative column within each group in the input data `X` and save them in the instance variable `grps_`. (For instance, one of the quantities you may calculate here is the standard deviation of `'c1'`, but only for the rows whose `'group'` is `'B'`.)\n",

    "If you `fit` and `transform` a `StdScalerByGroup` transformer on the `toy` DataFrame (without the `'y'` column), you should get back a DataFrame with two columns, `'c1'` and `'c2'`, with groups stored in the index (if you end up creating a `MultiIndex`, that is fine).\n",

    "### Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting whether or not passengers on the Titanic survived is a common first assignment when learning about classification ‚Äì now it's your turn!\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a function `titanic_model` that takes in a DataFrame `titanic` containing **training data only** and returns a `Pipeline` object fit to the training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "You have freedom to build your own model. That is, **you can use any classification algorithm**, but your model should satisfy the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model is built on the (binary) response column `'Survived'`.\n",
    "* The model uses features derived from **all other columns in `titanic`**. Below, we specify which columns to \"engineer\"; keep all other columns as-is.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Required feature engineering:\n",
    "    * Derive a feature from the \"title\" in the `'Name'` field (e.g. \"Mr\", \"Miss\", \"Mrs\" ‚Äì the names themselves should not be used as a feature; think about why).\n",
    "    * Derive a feature that standardizes passengers' ages among their `'Pclass'` (use Question 3!).\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Evaluation\n",
    "    \n",
    "Your model must achieve an accuracy of 0.78 on both the training set and a hidden test set. Note that you do not have access to the test set ‚Äì your model will be run on it after you submit to Gradescope. This means that it's important that you perform your own model validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extra credit: If your model can consistently earn an accuracy of above 0.83 on the (once again, hidden) test set, you can earn 5 points of extra credit on the lab!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some guidance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your submitted `titanic_model` function should have the model's hyperparameters (e.g. tree depth) hard-coded in it. That is, the `Pipeline` object doesn't have to include the hyperparameter selection process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You will find [FunctionTransformer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.FunctionTransformer.html) useful. If you want your transformer to output a categorical feature, you will need to select `validate=False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When using [ColumnTransformer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer.html#sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer), you may find the `remainder` keyword helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are set out to get those extra 5 points, consider building some meaningful features before fine-tuning the hyperparameters of your model. Do an EDA on the dataset ‚Äì what kinds of people are more prone to survive?"
