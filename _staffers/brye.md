Hi everyone! My name is Nicole, and I’m a fourth year data science major/student researcher from San Diego. When I’m not coding (or opening a bunch of Stack Overflow tabs), I enjoy figure skating and listening to music. DSC80 is an incredibly rewarding course and one of my personal favorites, and I’m looking forward to working with you all this quarter! :)
