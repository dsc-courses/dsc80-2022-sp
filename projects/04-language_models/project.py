    get_book that takes in the url of a 'Plain Text UTF-8' book and 
    returns a string containing the contents of the book.

    The function should satisfy the following conditions:
        - The contents of the book consist of everything between 
        Project Gutenberg's START and END comments.
        - The contents will include title/author/table of contents.
        - You should also transform any Windows new-lines (\r\n) with 
        standard new-lines (\n).
        - If the function is called twice in succession, it should not 
        violate the robots.txt policy.

    tokenize takes in book_string and outputs a list of tokens

        - The start of every paragraph should be represented in the 
        list with the single character \x02 (standing for START).
        - The end of every paragraph should be represented in the list 
        with the single character \x03 (standing for STOP).
        - Tokens should include no whitespace.
        - Whitespace (e.g. multiple newlines) between two paragraphs of text 
          should be ignored, i.e. they should not appear as tokens.
        - Two or more newlines count as a paragraph break.
        - All punctuation marks count as tokens, even if they are 
          uncommon (e.g. `'@'`, `'+'`, and `'%'` are all valid tokens).
