    "    - The reason for skipping around is that **the project has two distinct parts, and you should start on both parts by the time the checkpoint is due**.

If your code fails to run on the autograder due to efficiency reasons and it is past the late deadline, we will perform a \"catastrophic regrade\" by removing your inefficient code (deleting that function definition) and charging the usual cost of two slip days.

    "There has naturally been much interest in the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. In particular, recent reports suggest that the effectiveness of vaccines – and the Pfizer vaccine in particular – may decrease over time. While this is true, the public perception of declining vaccine effectiveness has been affected by what is often a poor use of statistics by media outlets.\n",
    "\n",

    "> Meanwhile, Israeli health officials reported what appeared to be a waning efficacy of the vaccine, including among those who had been double vaccinated. **Data showed that of the serious cases being admitted to hospital, around 60 per cent of patients were people who had been fully vaccinated**, though most were over 60 or with underlying health conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This stat sounds terrible – if you're sick in a hospital bed with COVID-19, you're actually more likely to be vaccinated than not! If you're not a data scientist, you might come away with the conclusion that the vaccine is no longer effective against serious illness, or – even worse – that getting the vaccine will **increase** your risk of sickness. Of course, this statistic by itself is actually meaningless. For instance, imagine a world in which 100% of people are vaccinated. Then 100% of people admitted to the hospital will be vaccinated, too! In Question 8, we will explain the theory behind **vaccine effectiveness**, a statistic that more meaningfully measures the improvement in outcomes for vaccinated individuals over unvaccinated individuals.\n",

    "To start, let's load in some data. For this project, we'll work with a dataset of vaccine effectiveness in Israel through mid-summer 2021. The vaccination and hospitalization records in the dataset are real. Israel was mostly vaccinated using the Pfizer vaccine, and was one of the first places where lots of data on the Delta variant was gathered."

    "\n",
    "As mentioned at the start of Part 2, looking at the probability of being vaccinated if you're hospitalized is meaningless, since if everyone is vaccinated, this probability will be 1. Instead, we care about **the probability of being hospitalized if you're vaccinated.** More than that, what we care most about is how this probability relates to the probability of being hospitalized if you're **unvaccinated**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it more concretely, let's say that 1 in 100 vaccinated people are hospitalized, while 10 in 100 unvaccinated people are hospitalized. This means that unvaccinated people are 10x more likely to be hospitalized than vaccinated people. To put it another way, if those 10 hospitalized unvaccinated people had been vaccinated, we'd expect that 9 of them would not have been hospitalized. That is, the vaccine would have prevented 90% of the hospitalizations, and we might therefore say that it is 90% effective against severe illness.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the intuition behind the definition of **vaccine effectiveness** (see the CDC's [page](https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson3/section6.html) for more information). That is, to compute a vaccine's effectiveness, we need to know two things:\n",

On the other hand, if the vaccine is no better than being unvaccinated, $p_V = p_U$ and the effectiveness is 0 (0%).\n",

We'll take a deeper look at this in the next question, but for now let's consider a slightly different scenario where we can give dosages of a vaccine on a scale, so that some people can receive more vaccine than others.

In the example above, we have constructed an extreme situation where essentially all older people are vaccinated, but almost no younger people are. Therefore, when calculating the overall vaccine effectiveness, we're using the probability of illness given vaccination – which is essentially the probability of severe illness if you're old – and comparing it to the probability of severe illness if you're unvaccinated, which is essentially the probability of severe illness if you're young.\n",
